- 📫 How to reach me jitendraprabhujp@gmail.com

I’m a Python Developer with 3+ years of experience building automation frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and intelligent systems that make workflows faster and smarter. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions using Python, GitHub Actions, and AI-driven automation.

Driven by curiosity, I’ve explored how AI agents, Agentic AI, LLMs, and workflow automation can transform the way software operates. I’ve built hands-on projects including AI-powered RAG system, VS code integrated auto-commit system, multi-agent system.

I’m passionate about applying my skills in Python, CI/CD, and AI integration to build reliable, future-ready systems that help teams move from manual processes to autonomous efficiency.

Skills: Python | Automation | CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | Agentic AI | LLMs | LangChain | RAG | System Design
